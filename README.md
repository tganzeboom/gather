Gathers information from a system a la facter, but written in python.

Since python is already installed on many systems, I thought it came in handy. I know there is Salt & Puppet etc. but facter needs a ruby install and I haven't looked thoroughly at Salt.

Thought it was fun to make.

It works but needs further improvements. If you have some ideas I'll look to see if I can incorporate them.
